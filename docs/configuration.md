# Configuration

termcoder reads config by layering, later sources overriding earlier ones:

```
schema defaults  <  global file  <  project file  <  environment
```

- **Global:** `~/.config/termcoder/config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/termcoder`).
- **Project:** the nearest `.termcoder/config.json` walking up from the working directory.
- **Environment:** `TERMCODER_MODEL`, `TERMCODER_THEME`, and provider keys.

Everything is validated against a Zod schema, so a malformed value fails loudly instead
of silently breaking later. The desktop **Settings** panel writes the same global file.

## Full example

```jsonc
{
  "model": "termcoder/auto",
  "theme": "default",
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": { "apiKey": "sk-ant-…" },
    "openai": { "baseURL": "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1", "apiKey": "gsk_…" }
  },
  "permission": { "edit": "ask", "bash": "ask", "write": "ask", "mcp": "ask" },
  "formatter": true,
  "keybinds": { "commandPalette": "mod+p" },
  "github": { "token": "ghp_…" }
}
```

## Models & providers

- `model` — a provider-qualified id, `"provider/model"`, e.g. `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"`,
  `"google/gemini-2.0-flash"`, `"ollama/llama3.1"`.
- `"termcoder/auto"` — a virtual model that routes to the best **configured** provider,
  preferring free/local (google → anthropic → openai → ollama). Override the order with
  `termcoder.route: ["ollama/qwen2.5", "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"]`.
- `providers.<name>.apiKey` — falls back to the usual env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, …).
- `providers.<name>.baseURL` — point an OpenAI-compatible provider (Groq, OpenRouter, a
  local server) at its endpoint.

See the root README for a no-cost setup with Ollama or a free tier.

## Permissions

Each mutating class — `bash`, `write`, `edit`, `mcp` — is `"ask"` (default), `"allow"`, or
`"deny"`. A class can instead be a **glob map** for path-aware control. The map is scanned
in order and the **last matching pattern wins**, so list the broad default first:

```jsonc
{
  "permission": {
    "edit": { "**": "ask", "src/**": "allow", "**/*.env": "deny" },
    "bash": { "**": "ask", "rm *": "deny" }
  }
}
```

Globs match the file path (write/edit) or the command string (bash). Supported: `**`
(any depth), `*` (within a path segment), `?` (one char).

Agents can carry their own permission map that overrides the global config for the kinds
it names — see below.

## Agents

Named model/prompt/permission/tool profiles. Built-ins: `build`, `plan`, `general`,
`explore`, `scout`. Define your own via config `agent.<name>` or a markdown file in
`.termcoder/agents/<name>.md` (project) or `~/.config/termcoder/agents/<name>.md` (global):

```markdown
---
description: Edits docs only
mode: primary
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
permission:
  edit: { "docs/**": allow, "**": deny }
  write: { "docs/**": allow, "**": deny }
tools: [read, ls, glob, grep, write, edit]
---
You maintain documentation. Keep prose tight and match the existing voice.
```

Frontmatter keys: `description`, `mode` (`primary`/`subagent`/`all`), `model`, `prompt`
(or the markdown body), `temperature`, `steps`, `permission`, `tools`, `color`. The body
becomes the agent's system prompt. In the desktop app the **Agents** settings tab has a
visual builder (including a "limit edits to paths" glob field).

## Commands

Custom slash-commands live in `.termcoder/commands/<name>.md` (or global). The body is a
template expanded before the prompt is sent:

```markdown
---
description: Summarize the current diff
agent: plan
---
Summarize these changes for a commit message:

!`git diff --staged`
```

- `$ARGUMENTS` / `$1`, `$2`, … — interpolate the command's arguments.
- `` !`shell` `` — run a shell command in the workspace and inject its output.
- `@path` — inject a file's contents.

Type `/` in the desktop composer to browse commands with a live preview of the expanded
prompt.

## Skills

Skills are reusable playbooks the agent pulls in **on demand**. Drop a markdown file
in `.termcoder/skills/<name>.md` (project) or `~/.config/termcoder/skills/<name>.md`
(global):

```markdown
---
name: pr-review
description: Review a pull request for correctness and style
---
1. Read the diff with `git diff main...HEAD`.
2. For each changed file, check error handling, edge cases, and naming.
3. Summarize findings grouped by severity; suggest concrete fixes.
```

Only the **name + description** of each skill are placed in the system prompt (cheap).
When a task matches, the agent calls the built-in `skill` tool to load the full body —
so a library of skills costs almost nothing until one is actually used (the same
progressive-disclosure idea behind the token-economy settings below). Manage them in the
desktop **Skills** settings tab, or list them with `/skills` in the TUI.

Ready-made skills to copy live in
[docs/examples/skills/](./examples/skills/) (commit-message, pr-review, add-tests).

## Token economy

Long sessions get expensive because every turn resends the history, including past tool
outputs. Two knobs (under `context`) bound that:

```jsonc
{ "context": { "maxToolOutputChars": 8000, "keepRecentToolResults": 6 } }
```

- `maxToolOutputChars` — caps how much of each tool result is sent to the model (the UI
  still shows the full output).
- `keepRecentToolResults` — keeps this many recent tool outputs in full; older ones are
  elided from the model's context so they stop being re-billed every turn.

Tune both in the desktop **Behavior** settings tab.

## Formatters

Auto-format files after a successful write/edit. `"formatter": true` enables the
built-ins (prettier, gofmt, rustfmt, ruff, shfmt, clang-format — each skipped if its
binary isn't installed). Configure per name, or add a custom one:

```jsonc
{
  "formatter": {
    "prettier": { "extensions": [".ts", ".tsx", ".css"] },
    "black": { "command": ["black", "$FILE"], "extensions": [".py"] }
  }
}
```

`$FILE` is replaced with the edited file's path. Set `"disabled": true` on a built-in to
turn it off.

## Keybinds

Override the desktop app's shortcuts. Keys are action ids; values are combos where `mod`
is Ctrl (⌘ on macOS):

```jsonc
{ "keybinds": { "commandPalette": "mod+p", "newSession": "mod+shift+n" } }
```

Actions: `commandPalette`, `newSession`, `toggleSessions`, `toggleFiles`, `openFolder`.
The **Shortcuts** settings tab records these interactively.

## MCP, LSP, plugins

- `mcp` — external [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers (`stdio` or `http`);
  their tools are namespaced `<server>_<tool>`.
- `lsp` — language servers keyed by the extensions they handle; enables a `diagnostics`
  tool.
- `plugins` — module specifiers (package names or file paths) that add tools.

Each is documented with examples in the root [README](../README.md). Tools dropped in
`.termcoder/tools/*.{js,mjs,cjs}` are auto-discovered too.

## GitHub

```jsonc
{ "github": { "token": "ghp_…" } }
```

Used to publish a session transcript as a secret Gist (`POST /sessions/:id/gist`). A
classic token with the `gist` scope is enough; it's stored locally and the server only
ever exposes whether a token exists, never its value. Falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
